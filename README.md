# material-ui-datepickerdialog-example

This is an example for opening the Material-UI DatePicker with a button rather than a text input. I created this quick example to document all of the trouble I went through trying to figure out how to do this. 

[You can read more about what needs to be done to fix this bug right here](https://nozzlegear.com/blog/datepickerdialog-how-to-open-material-ui-s-datepicker-with-a-button-or-any-other-element).

## Run the example

Install modules and build the package:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install; 

# Build files
yarn build;
```

Then open the index.html file in your browser.
